# MATE ROV Competition
This is the repository for Team *TBD* for the 2023 MATE ROV Competition.

## Arduino
The code is mainly written in C++. It is recommended by the MATE manual to use Arduino IDE. Testing scripts is best done in the Arduino IDE, however you can write the code in your IDE of choice as long as you are able to use Arduino IDE for testing.

### Controller
Thanks to Angel, we are now ready to start loading code onto the controller for the ROV. We will be creating scripts to display text on the display for the device during this weeks meeting.
