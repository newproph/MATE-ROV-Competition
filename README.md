# MATE ROV Competition
This is the Deep Sea Dogs repository for the 2023 MATE ROV Competition.

## Arduino
The code is mainly written in C++. It is recommended by the MATE manual to use Arduino IDE. Testing scripts is best done in the Arduino IDE, however you can write the code in your IDE of choice as long as you are able to use Arduino IDE for testing.

### Controller
Top of the to do list is to make the motors control in a way that makes sense rather than have diagonal up right be up and diagonal down right be down. Will update page when Remi and I get some ideas of how to do this.
